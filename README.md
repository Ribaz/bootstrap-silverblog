# bootstrap-silverblog

In the beginning, there was a free HTML template called "silverblog" that I used for my personal Web site.
This template was one of the first Web experiments while HTML 5 tecnologies were only a draft.
Moreover, it was not compatible with some Web browser like Internet Exporer 8 or Android stock browser.

Recently I wanted to "update" this already cute graphic for my site adding tecnologies like Bootstrap for make it responsive and an HTML code certified for the new consolidated standard (released few years later).
So I changed some code of it (rewriting whole part of HTML code) for my personal use and now I share my rework with you.


_Below, a preview in a Web browser:_

You can use this template but remember that the original work was done by CSSHeaven (http://cssheaven.org).
